### Supported Operating System for Docker Installation

LUCY runs on Docker. Docker Engine is supported on Linux, Cloud, Windows, and OS X.

<details>

<summary>What is Docker?</summary>

[**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) is a platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers. These containers can run on any system that has Docker installed, ensuring that the software works consistently across different environments.

**Key Features of Docker:**

* **Portability:** Docker containers can be run on any machine with Docker installed, making it easy to move Lucy between environments.
* **Isolation:** Each Docker container runs in isolation, which means it doesn't interfere with other containers or the host system.
* **Efficiency:** Containers share the host system's kernel, making them more lightweight and faster to start compared to traditional virtual machines.

#### How Lucy Uses Docker

Using Docker, Lucy can be deployed consistently and efficiently across different systems. Here's how Docker is used in the context of Lucy:

1. **Containerization:** Lucy is packaged as a Docker container, which includes all the necessary software and dependencies. This ensures that Lucy runs the same way on any system with Docker installed.
2. **Port Management:** The installer script ensures that the necessary network ports (25, 80, and 443) are available and not used by other services. These ports, such as handling web traffic and email communications, are essential for Lucy's operations.
3. **Automated Installation:** The installer script automates setting up Docker (if it's not already installed) and configuring it to run Lucy. This reduces the complexity of installation and ensures that all necessary steps are followed correctly.
4. **Isolation and Security:** Running Lucy in a Docker container isolates it from other applications on the host system. This improves security and reduces the risk of conflicts with other software.

<summary>Hardware <strong>Recommendations</strong></summary>

* **Initial Setup:** Ensure that your initial hardware setup meets the minimum requirements for your expected campaign size. It's better to allocate more resources upfront to avoid performance bottlenecks.
* **Storage Planning:** Given the potential need for additional templates and the data generated by campaigns, planning for ample storage from the beginning is wise. Consider future expansion when selecting your hard disk size.
* **Use Built-in Tools:** Regularly utilize LUCY's [performance testing ](../../application-screens-reference/support/system-tests/performance-test.md)and [monitoring tools](../../application-screens-reference/support/status/system-monitoring.md) to keep your system running efficiently. These tools can provide valuable insights into how well your hardware is coping with the demands of your campaigns.
* **Flexible Scaling:** If you are hosting your LUCY instance on a VPS, take advantage of the ability to scale your resources as needed. This can be particularly useful for handling peak loads during large campaigns.

**VPS Hosting**

For users opting for a Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosted by LUCY:

* **Dynamic Resource Scaling.** LUCY provides the capability to automatically scale computing resources, including CPU and RAM, to meet the demands of your campaign. This feature ensures optimal performance of campaigns by adjusting resources in real time, eliminating the need for manual adjustments. In case of hardware limitations, users are encouraged to contact the[ support department](../../when-to-contact-us/contact-technical-support.md) for assistance in scaling their Virtual Private Server (VPS).
