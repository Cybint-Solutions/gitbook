# Network Communication

LUCY may initiate or require certain communication channels to servers on the internet.\
Below is an overview of these requirements.

***

## Outbound Communication

### General Communication Types

1. **First-Time Use**: During the first installation, LUCY connects via HTTP to obtain the workstation key and ID. No data beyond the current build version is transmitted.
2. **Updates**: LUCY connects to our update server and Ubuntu repository mirror.
3. **SSH**: When SSH is enabled via the Help menu, LUCY initiates an outbound SSH connection to our SSH Jump Host. This feature is disabled by default.
4. **Campaign Checks**: LUCY connects to fixed servers to test campaign settings and internet reachability via HTTP/HTTPS. No data is transmitted during these tests.
5. **Campaign Execution**: LUCY may communicate via SMTP (Port 25 or 465) when sending emails over the internet.
6. **Vulnerability Detection**: To enable this feature, allow Port 80 access to `static.nvd.nist.gov` (129.6.13.177) for downloading the NIST CVE database.

## Inbound Communication

To access LUCY from the internet, specific ports must be open:

| Source IP | Destination         | Port                | Protocol | Comment                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ANY       | Your LUCY Server IP | 80/443 (HTTP/HTTPS) | TCP      | Required for accessing landing pages and certificate verification. |
| ANY       | Your LUCY Server IP | 25 (SMTP)           | TCP      | Only needed for catching email replies.                            |

## Malware Simulation Communication

The malware simulation tool uses the default browser (in hidden mode) to send collected data to LUCY via HTTP or HTTPS. For SSL-enabled campaigns, HTTPS is used automatically. The tool is compatible with environments requiring proxy authentication for internet access.
