# Deploying Outlook Native

### Introduction

The native Outlook plugin supports these versions of the desktop application:

* Outlook 2016
* Outlook 2019
* Office 365 Desktop

The Outlook plugin is static, it cannot read changes from the Lucy server like the Office 365 version can. If you want to change settings, you must re-download the plugin and redeploy.

On the Domain Controller, open the Group Policy Management Console (`gpmc.msc`).

#### **3. Create a New GPO**

Right-click on the **Organizational Unit (OU)** where you want to deploy the plugin, and select **Create a GPO in this domain, and link it here**.

Name the GPO (e.g., _Deploy Lucy Plugin_).

In the Group Policy Management Editor, navigate to **Computer Configuration > Policies > Software Settings > Software Installation**.

#### **5. Add the Plugin for Deployment**

Right-click **Software Installation**, select **New > Package**.

#### **6. Update Group Policy on Target Computers**

Either wait for the next Group Policy update cycle or force an update manually by running\
`gpupdate /force`.

## Technical Information

* The MSI logs operations under `C:\ProgramData\LucySecurity`
* Upon installation a temporary `config.dat` file is created, but all settings are written in the registry. The plugin may be installed in the user context (HKCU) or machine context (HKLM).
* The Plugin is available in 32 and 64-bit versions, so make sure you're downloading the correct one.
