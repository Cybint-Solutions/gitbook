# Adding a New Client

<details>

<summary>What is a Client?</summary>

Lucyâ€™s architecture utilizes a client framework to organize information, where each client acts as a container for elements such as campaigns, templates, and user access. This structure promotes data segregation and improved security, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. Clients can be customized to suit various needs: a single client is appropriate for one organization, while managing multiple organizations requires distinct clients for each, allowing tailored control and security for every organization.
