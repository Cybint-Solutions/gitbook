# Recipients

**Adding your recipients**\
\
Lucy offers several ways to add recipients within the platform. Using the wizard, you can either choose an existing group or create a new one.

{% hint style="info" %}
For additional details on how to create existing recipient groups with import capabilities, including automatic[ LDAP](../../../../application-screens-reference/settings/common-system-settings/ldap-settings.md) or [Azure Entra ID](../../../../application-screens-reference/settings/common-system-settings/azure-applications.md) integration, please refer to our section on [recipients](../../../../application-screens-reference/users/recipient-groups.md).
{% endhint %}

In this scenario, we will choose the "New Group" option and input the recipient's name and email address. This process can be repeated to add more recipients.
