<summary>Awareness Domain Hints</summary>

When directing recipients to Awareness content, it's important to associate a familiar and trusted domain.&#x20;

Recipients, having just completed a successful phishing simulation, may be wary of clicking unfamiliar links. Using a known domain can reduce this hesitation and increase engagement with the training material.\
\
There are two methods to accomplish this:\
\
1\. You can send emails from a domain associated with your company using the internal Lucy mail server. Please make sure that all necessary DNS records are correctly configured and pointing to your Lucy server before initiating the campaign. For more details, refer to our [domain section](../../../../application-screens-reference/settings/common-system-settings/domains/).\
\
2\. You can directly authenticate to your company SMTP server to send the training directly from your internal mail server, refer to our [SMTP section](../../../../application-screens-reference/settings/common-system-settings/smtp-servers.md).

**4.2** Adjust the Awareness email body:\
\
Lucy comes with generic email responses. It is highly encouraged to personalize these Awareness Training emails according to your company's branding and ethos. \
