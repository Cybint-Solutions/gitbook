# Mail & Web Filter Test

## Understanding the Attack

The Mail and Web Filter Test provides insight into how your mail server and web proxy handle various types of test files. It allows you to assess whether the filtering infrastructure detects and blocks potential malicious content such as Java files, scripts, and embedded Office objects. Based on the results, you can refine your security measures and execute targeted phishing simulations to improve defenses.
