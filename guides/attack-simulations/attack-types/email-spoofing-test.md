# Email Spoofing Test

## Overview

Email spoofing is the forgery of an email header, making it appear as though the message originated from someone or somewhere other than its actual source. This tactic is commonly used in phishing and spam campaigns, as individuals are more likely to open emails they believe have been sent by a legitimate source. The goal of email spoofing is to entice recipients to open the email and potentially respond to the solicitation.
