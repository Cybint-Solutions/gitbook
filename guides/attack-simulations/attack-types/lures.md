# Lures

## Understanding the Attack

A lure is not an attack on its own, but most attack types can have a lure attached to them in the Attack Settings. Lures prepare the targets of a phishing campaign for the phishing email, lowering the user's guard and tricking them into believing that the email is real.

## Checklist

* [x] [Register an attack domain](../../quick-guides/create-your-first-campaign/register-an-attack-domain.md)
* [x] Enable **Double Barrel Attack** in the Attack Settings and set a delay
* [x] Design a Lure email (see below)

## Lure Emails

First enable the **Double Barrel Attack** setting, set a delay, and save:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (894).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
The delay is in seconds, so 1800 seconds is 30 minutes between the lure and the attack.
{% endhint %}

Then go to the **Lure Template** tab and create a lure email:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (895).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
You are now ready to use lures in your campaign.
{% endhint %}
