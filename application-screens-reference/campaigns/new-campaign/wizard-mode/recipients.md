# Recipients

**Adding your recipients**\
\
Lucy provides multiple methods to include recipients within the platform. When utilizing the wizard, you have the option to select an existing group or create a new one.

For additional details on how to create existing recipient groups with import capabilities, including automatic[ LDAP](../../../settings/common-system-settings/ldap-settings.md) or [Azure Entra ID](../../../settings/common-system-settings/azure-applications.md) integration, please refer to our section on [recipients](../../../users/recipient-groups.md).\
\
In this scenario, we will choose the "New Group" option and input the recipient's name and email address. This process can be repeated to add more recipients.
