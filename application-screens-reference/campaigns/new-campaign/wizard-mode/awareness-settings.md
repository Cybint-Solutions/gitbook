You will be redirected to the Awareness Template Gallery, where you can search for, dynamically preview, and select the Awareness Template that elaborates on the attack scenario.\

\
For example, previewing the landing page:\
\

<summary>Awareness Domain Hints</summary>

When directing recipients to Awareness content, it's important to associate a familiar and trusted domain.&#x20;

Since recipients have just experienced a successful phishing simulation, they might be hesitant to click on unfamiliar links. Using a known domain can help alleviate these concerns and encourage engagement with the training material.\
\
There are two methods to accomplish this:\
\
1\. You can send emails from a domain associated with your company using the internal Lucy mail server. Please make sure that all necessary DNS records are correctly configured and pointing to your Lucy server before initiating the campaign. For more details, refer to our [domain section](../../../settings/common-system-settings/domains/).\
\
2\. You can directly authenticate to your company SMTP server to send the training directly from your internal mail server, refer to our [SMTP section](../../../settings/common-system-settings/smtp-servers.md).

**4.2** Adjust the Awareness email body:\
\
Lucy comes with generic email responses, it is highly encouraged for the Awareness training emails to personalize these according to your company branding and ethos. \
