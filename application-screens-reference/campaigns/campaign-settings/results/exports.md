<details>

<summary>Recipient Statistics Descriptions</summary>

* **All**: Exports the entire dataset of campaign recipients without any filters applied.
* **All By Recipient Group**: Allows you to export data for specific groups of recipients.&#x20;
* **Succeeded**: Filters and exports data for recipients who completed the desired action of the attack, indicating they were successfully phished.
* **Not Succeeded**: Selects recipients who did not complete the attack's intended action, meaning the phishing attempt was unsuccessful with them.
* **Clicked**: Focuses on recipients who clicked on the link in the phishing email, message (SMS), or link to Awareness training.
* **Started Training**: Filters recipients who have begun the training modules provided in the campaign.
* **Not Started Training**: Exports data for recipients who have not initiated any training modules linked to the campaign.
* **Completed Training**:  Filters recipients who have gone through and completed the training modules.
* **Downloaded File**: Identifies recipients who have downloaded a file, as part of an attack or malware simulation.
* **Visits**: Exports data on all recipients who visited the campaign's landing pages.
* **Scenario Visits**: Focuses on recipients who visited a specific scenario in the campaign.
* **Awareness Visits**: Filters out data for recipients who visited the awareness pages that are typically set up to educate them post-engagement with the phishing attempt.
* **Quiz Answers**: Exports data specifically related to the recipients' engagement with quizzes, such as answers submitted.
* **Received Training Certificate**: Filters and exports data for recipients who have received a certificate upon completing a training module, signifying their participation and completion.
* **Clicks Data**: Provides detailed data on the interactions of recipients with the phishing links, such as the time of click and frequency.

### Recipient Success Actions

<details>

<summary>Recipient Success Actions Descriptions</summary>

* **Succeeded to Group**: This option allows you to filter and export data for recipients who have been successfully phished or who have completed the desired success action in the campaign. The recipients who meet this criterion will be grouped together, which can be useful for follow-up actions such as simulating or training again.
* **Not Succeeded to Group**: Contrary to the above, this option will filter out and export data for recipients who did not fall for the phishing attempt or who did not complete the intended success action. These recipients are also grouped, allowing you to target them for more challenging simulations.
* **Clicked to Group**: This selection filters recipients based on whether they clicked on a phishing link or not. It groups the clickers, providing a list of those who showed initial engagement with the phishing content.

### Export recipients within a submitted time range to a new group.

This option exports data for recipients within a specified time range to a new group. This is useful for creating segments of recipients who have been active or participated within a certain period, and facilitating targeted follow-up campaigns or analyses.

### Export campaign benchmark results

The Benchmark export provides a snapshot of campaign performance by compiling key metrics like message delivery, open rates, click-throughs, and overall success rates into a comprehensive report.

### Export collected data

This export option compiles a detailed log of user interactions from the campaign, recording entries like timestamps, participant details, associated scenarios, and specific user-submitted information, exemplified by login credentials.

### Automated Export

Automated Exports is a functionality that allows for the scheduled and recurrent generation of reports based on predefined criteria and intervals.

{% hint style="info" %}
Navigate to a **Campaign -> Results -> Automated Exports**
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (357).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Export Target**: Choose data sets to automate, like All Victims, Not Succeeded, Clicks Data, or Campaign Benchmark.
* **Export Frequency**: Set the frequency for the exportâ€”daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.
* **Export Time**: Decide the specific time of day for the export to run.
* **Export Days**: Specify which days the export should occur, based on the chosen frequency.
* **Export Type**: Select the format of the exported file, such as XML or CSV.

This tool is designed to regularly provide fresh data without manual effort, aiding consistent and timely analysis sent directly to the email address of the campaign creator.

***

### Alternative Export Methods

* **API Integration**: LUCY offers [API access](../../../settings/common-system-settings/api-whitelist/) for users preferring automated data retrieval.
