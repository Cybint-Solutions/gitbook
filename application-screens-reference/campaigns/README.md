# Campaigns

A campaign is a structured program designed to assess and improve employees' understanding and response to cybersecurity threats. It typically includes simulated attacks, such as phishing, and educational content about best practices in cybersecurity.

These campaigns serve as benchmarks for an organization's security awareness level, helping to identify areas of risk and plan for future training to mitigate these risks.
