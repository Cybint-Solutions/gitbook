### Awareness Template Variations

LUCY provides a variety of ready-to-use e-learning templates, which are continually updated.  These templates include rich media options like videos and interactive elements to enhance engagement.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Games" %}
Gamification in cybersecurity awareness training incorporates interactive challenges and rewards to engage participants, making learning about security protocols both fun and memorable.

For example, search for **Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: Test your phishing know-how!**

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="1 Pagers" %}
1 Pager templates in LUCY serve as immediate feedback mechanisms for users who have been deceived by a phishing simulation. These templates are designed to:

* Quickly inform users of their mistake without causing panic.
* Provide a brief, clear warning that explains the simulation's intent.
* Encourage users to remain vigilant against real phishing attempts.
* Suggest further training to improve their cybersecurity awareness.

For example, search for **One Pager: Customizable template**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (79).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

These templates are fully customizable, allowing for the addition of pointers about the recent phishing simulation and the ability to upload custom images.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Micro Learning" %}
Microlearning in security awareness training uses short, focused modules to teach specific security practices, enhancing retention and fitting easily into busy schedules.

For example, search for **Microlearning-Google sign in**

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Advanced Learning" %}
Advanced Learning templates incorporate multiple quizzes, a final exam, and interactive tasks and videos to deeply engage learners and reinforce complex security topics.

For example, search for **Information Security in Ai**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/chrome_VDZ7aaAQCQ (1).gif" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Exams Only" %}
Exam-only templates focus solely on delivering assessments to end users, testing their knowledge and understanding of security practices without preceding instructional content.

### Filtering

With Lucy's extensive template repository, using filters is advantageous to identify which templates are automatically translated into your preferred languages, relevance to your target audiences, category, or difficulty level.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Language" %}
The language filter displays all templates available in the chosen languages. Initially, only a subset of 10 languages is shown by default.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (316).png" alt="" width="204"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To locate languages not listed, utilize the language search bar.



<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (317).png" alt="" width="201"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Type" %}
The type section classifies the format of the content within the awareness templates. This helps in selecting a delivery method that will most effectively engage the target audience and reinforce learning.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (394).png" alt="" width="296"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Video**:

* Multimedia presentations often incorporating visual and auditory elements to illustrate security concepts.

**Quiz**:

* Interactive assessments designed to test the audience's understanding of the security material covered.

**Game**:

This allows administrators to filter templates based on the mode of information delivery that best suits their campaign's objectives.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Target Audience" %}
The target audience filter helps you find all awareness templates relevant to the specific group within your organization you are aiming to train or evaluate. Some awareness templates are tailor-made for technical staff like developers or system administrators, while others are suited for corporate users, including C-level executives.

This targeting ensures that the material is relevant and the language used is appropriate for the audience's role and level of expertise.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Difficulty Level" %}
The Difficulty Level categorizes awareness templates based on the level of complexity and the knowledge required to understand the content. This classification aids in selecting the appropriate template that matches the intended audience's expertise.

**Low Level**:

* Suitable for a broad audience, including individuals with minimal to no prior knowledge of security awareness topics.
* The content is straightforward and uses basic language to ensure comprehension.

**Medium Level**:

* Targeted at users with a moderate understanding of security concepts.
* Templates include more detailed information and may introduce more complex terms, requiring a foundational level of security awareness.

**High Level**:

* Complex concepts and industry-specific jargon are prevalent, necessitating a high degree of familiarity with the subject matter.

**Implementation**

* When creating or editing awareness templates, select the appropriate difficulty level that best matches the complexity of the material and the intended audience's expertise level.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (397).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This categorization helps administrators to filter and choose templates that align with their educational goals and the knowledge level of their audience.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Duration" %}
The duration section specifies the length of time required to complete an awareness activity or consume content. This information helps in planning and allocating appropriate time slots for security training sessions.
