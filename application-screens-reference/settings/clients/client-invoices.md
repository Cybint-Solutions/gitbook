# Client Invoices

Introduction

Each time you add to your workstation's balance Lucy generates an invoice for the transaction. These invoices are available to view and download on this page.

## Refilling your workstation's balance

The balance on your workstation can be used to purchase domains and send SMS. You can refill this balance on your **License** page and clicking **Add Balance**:

### Payment options

You can add to your workstation balance using Stripe or by arranging a wire transfer through your Account Manager. Lucy creates a PDF invoice automatically that is added to your Client Invoices page.
