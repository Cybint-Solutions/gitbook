LUCY can forward suspicious emails to your organization's abuse contact for further investigation. You can define a template for these emails on the Abuse page.

There are three variables available for this email template:

1. **%domain%** - the domain name or IP address of the email's sender.
2. **%email%** - the sender's email address.
3. **%time%** - the sending time of the reported email.

### How to send reports

Suspicious emails can be forwarded to your abuse contact right from the incidents dashboard. Just click the "Send" icon next to any incident to report it:
