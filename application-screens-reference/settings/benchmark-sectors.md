# Benchmark Sectors

Navigate to **Settings -> Benchmark Sectors**.

## Key Points About Benchmarks

* **Internal Database:** Benchmarks use an internal database, and **no data is ever submitted to our server**.
* **Anonymous Data Submission:** When using LUCY for the first time, you will be asked once if you want to submit anonymous data. The default option is **no submission of anonymous data**. Your choice is stored in the **Advanced Settings**.

By default, the **Industry** field is empty. The more tests you perform, the easier it will be to compare results in the future if you assign a Benchmark to each test.

{% hint style="info" %}
Benchmark results are **not shared** among LUCY installations. No campaign data will ever be transmitted to external servers.
{% endhint %}

## Using Benchmarks

You can set a **Benchmark** for a campaign when starting it. Benchmarks allow you to compare results across different campaigns and sectors, especially useful if you use LUCY to perform phishing campaigns for multiple clients.

To assign a benchmark simply select an **Industry** option when creating the campaign. You can also assign this to existing campaigns under the **Base Settings.**
