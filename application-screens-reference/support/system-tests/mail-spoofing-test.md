# Mail Spoofing Test

Introduction

Email spoofing is the forgery of an email header so that the message appears to have originated from someone or somewhere other than the actual source. This tactic is commonly used in phishing and spam campaigns because recipients are more likely to open an email if they believe it is from a legitimate source. The goal of email spoofing is to deceive recipients into opening and possibly responding to a solicitation.
