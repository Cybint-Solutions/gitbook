# Reboot

### Introduction

If you need to restart your Lucy server for any reason, you can do so right from your dashboard:

{% hint style="info" %}
Navigate to **Support -> Reboot**
{% endhint %}

### On-premise options for restarting

On-premise installations have direct access to the Lucy host, and so have additional options when it comes to rebooting the workstation. In addition to the above page, users with access to the server can reboot with an appropriate Linux command such as `sudo shutdown -r` or by running the setup script and selecting the reboot option:

```
sudo python /opt/phishing/current/tools/setup/setup.py
```
