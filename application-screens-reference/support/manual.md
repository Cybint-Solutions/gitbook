# Manual

### Introduction

By default this page links to Lucy's official wiki site (this site), however you may edit this in the [whitelabel](../settings/whitelabeling.md) settings and link anywhere you like.

This allows you to host your own copy of our documentation for your users, whether you have strict network security policies and cannot link to an external site or you just want to host a sub-section of our wiki for users with limited permissions.

Whatever the case, this page provides a convenient portal to your documentation.
