# Update

### Introduction

There are three types of updates for Lucy:

1. **Major** updates make changes to the application code and environment. Major updates are not guaranteed to maintain compatibility with uploaded assets from earlier versions of the application.
2. **Minor/Patch** updates apply hotfixes and other small patch fixes to the environment.
3. **Template** updates are separate from version updates and are applied to our template server. Users receive notifications on their Lucy dashboard when new templates are available.

### How can I find out about available updates?

If your workstation does not have the latest version of Lucy installed, you will receive an alert upon logging in. This alert only appears once per update - once a user on your workstation dismisses it, Lucy will not alert you about that update again.

You can check for updates at any time by going to **Support -> Update.** Click **Check Update** to initiate a connection to our update server so that Lucy can scan for available updates. If one is available you will see it for download:

### Automatically stay up-to-date

Starting in version 4.14 there is an optional **Auto Update** setting in the [**Advanced System Settings**](../settings/advanced-system-settings/)**.** With this setting your workstation will automatically download and install all minor and patch updates. Major updates still require manual intervention.

Also starting in version 4.14 it is no longer necessary to pause campaigns before applying minor and patch updates, so you can use this setting safely with running campaigns.

### Scheduled Updates

Another new feature in version 4.14, you can now schedule your updates to automatically download and install at a time of your choosing:
