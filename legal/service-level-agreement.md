# Service Level Agreement

We provide technical support services to customers of Lucy Securityto ensure end-user satisfaction. We currently provide full support services on business days, Monday through Friday between 8.00 am and 6.00 pm CEST respectively CET.

Customers get access to the Companyâ€™s support portal. Lucy Security customers should communicate errors, including documentation, immediately and in writing to our company via support@lucysecurity.com; stating the possible cause, and to provide us with the opportunity to resolve the error in question. The error must be reproducible. Should it prove impossible to resolve an error directly within support-services, error resolution will be performed in a troubleshooting (first by analyzing log files and second by accessing the system via SSH or in a web meeting).
