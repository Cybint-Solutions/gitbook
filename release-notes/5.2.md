# 5.2

## Release Notes <a href="#release_notes" id="release_notes"></a>

#### **December 2024**

We are excited to introduce Lucy version 5.2, featuring a fully redesigned and enhanced End User Portal. This update focuses on delivering a modern awareness training portal with real-time user behavior metrics while providing administrators with deeper insights into performance and training outcomes across their organization.\


### [**End User Portal**](../application-screens-reference/users/end-users.md) **Enhancements**

* **New User Statistics Dashboard:** The End User Portal now boasts a sleek, modern interface for user profiles. Upon login, users are greeted with an overall Statistics Dashboard, where they can quickly view their personal scores, risk ratings, and training history in one unified view.
* **Risk Rating and Attack Simulation Statistics:** The risk rating system provides a quick glance at a user's security risk score, with a key improvement: user activities are now benchmarked against their respective organization. This allows both end users and administrators to evaluate performance in the context of their specific organization’s security goals.
* **Training History and Diplomas:** Users now have streamlined access to their entire training history, complete with a dedicated section for storing all diplomas.
* **Enhanced Course View:** Training materials are now displayed on a dedicated Awareness Training Courses page, featuring an improved Kanban-style board for a filtered view of all courses. Easily track progress with columns for "Not Started," "In Progress," and "Finished."

### **Additional Enhancements**

* **AI-Powered Wiki:** Explore our newly enhanced, AI-powered wiki in BETA release at [https://wiki.lucysecurity.com](https://wiki.lucysecurity.com/)
* **Recipient Grouping:** Create [recipient groups](../application-screens-reference/users/recipient-groups.md) directly within the [campaign creation wizard](../application-screens-reference/campaigns/new-campaign/wizard-mode/) for a streamlined setup.
* [**System-wide Filters**](../application-screens-reference/settings/common-system-settings/filter-settings.md)**:** Manage IP address and User-Agent rules across all campaigns via the UI, centralizing campaign access control and minimizing false positives.
* **Email Control Flexibility:** Granular options in the “Do Not Send Emails” feature let admins specify exactly which emails to exclude.
* **License Page Redesign:** License-related actions are now neatly organized under clear headings, improving [license management](../application-screens-reference/account-settings/license.md).
* **Notifications Module:** All [system notifications](../application-screens-reference/support/status/notifications.md)—read and unread—are now available in a centralized view, giving administrators easy access to updates, system errors, new templates, and general alerts.
* **Azure OAuth API Permission Updates:** Permissions for Azure OAuth 2.0 have been refined, requesting only OpenID for secure authentication across both [SSO](../application-screens-reference/settings/common-system-settings/sso-configuration.md) and the [XML Reporting plugin](../guides/reporting-plugin/).
* **Storage Optimization:** Storage checks now predict usage more accurately, allowing or denying operations based on precise storage requirements.
