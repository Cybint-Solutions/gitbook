### Key Enhancements

#### New Design of the Risk Level Page

The Risk Level page in the Users section has been completely redesigned for better usability. You can now adjust risk levels using intuitive sliders instead of entering percentage ranges manually. Each range is color-coded for clarity, and you can define up to ten custom risk levels for more precise categorization based on your organization’s needs.

#### Risk Level Configuration - Now per client

Previously, multi-tenant administrators couldn’t tailor risk levels for individual clients. With this release, you can now configure risk level settings separately for each client.&#x20;

#### New Tour guide  &#x20;

Lucy now includes interactive guided walkthroughs for new and redesigned pages. These step-by-step tours highlight key changes and features, providing brief, helpful explanations to ensure users understand the functionality. Designed for both new and experienced users, the walkthroughs make it easier to explore updates and get the most out of each feature. In this release, you can find it in the Risk Level Page.



#### New Notification Box

We have improved the functionality of the notifications module that is placed in the top right corner of Lucy. Clicking the notification bell now triggers a slide-down panel showing only unread messages, with options to mark them as read and a quick link to view all notifications.

#### &#x20;Scheduler Changes

The campaign scheduler in the Campaign Configuration section has been updated with improved timing logic and reworked Sort Types: By Recipient and By Scenario. These changes help prevent overlaps and duplicate sending, ensure accurate delivery windows, and allow users to add new recipients on the go without breaking the settings.

Features for Beta users (with the assistance of Lucy Support)

#### WhatsApp Smishing Campaigns

Following popular demand, we are excited to introduce a new capability: WhatsApp smishing simulation, allowing testing the employees with new attack vectors in Attack campaigns. This option can be found in the Attack Settings under Message Type.

#### Messente SMS Provider

Users can now choose Messente as a custom SMS delivery provider when configuring a smishing campaign. Different providers offer different deliverability across the demanded smishing destinations. The Messente Provider option offers more flexibility for reaching global recipients, especially in regions where delivery via existing providers may be limited.
