# 5.3

## Release Notes

#### January 2025

We’re thrilled to introduce Lucy version 5.3, packed with exciting features and enhancements to improve your experience. Here’s what’s new:

### Key Features and Enhancements

* New Filter Tabs: Simplify navigation with “Installed” and “Downloads” tabs in both the Awareness and Attack template galleries, enabling quick filtering and faster access to relevant templates.
* “New Templates” & “Template Updates” Filter: Easily distinguish between templates not yet downloaded (“New Templates”) and those with available updates (“Template Updates”).
* Template Update Improvements: We’ve improved the template update process to make it more seamless and efficient with a new multi-select filter called “Template Updates.” Now, when you select one or more templates and choose either “Update and Replace” or “Create Updated Copy” from the “Update Selected” dropdown, Lucy will apply the selected action to all chosen templates in your directory at once, saving you time and effort.
* Real-Attack Email Conversion: Transform actual phishing emails into training templates, preserving original images, text, and elements for more evidence-based training.

### Additional Enhancements

* New Downloads Progress Page: Track and manage your downloads with the new interactive downloads page. It provides real-time progress tracking, lets you selectively cancel items, and ensures a transparent and stable download experience.
* Invoices: Easily view and manage your balance-refill invoices on a dedicated page for streamlined financial oversight.
* Storage Management: Before starting a download, Lucy evaluates and reserves the required disk space, ensuring smooth and efficient operations.
* Lucy on RedHat: For on-premise installations, Lucy is now available on RedHat, catering to organizations prioritizing RedHat-based products for enhanced security and compliance.
